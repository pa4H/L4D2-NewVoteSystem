# L4D2-NewVoteSystem

The voting system is written from scratch.

Plugin allows you to:
1. Create custom votes: sm_customVote <VoteText> <PassVoteText>
2. Vote for kick of a player from another team.
3. Vote for killing infected bots: !killbots, !kb.
4. Vote for kick of spectators: !kickspec, !ks, !speckick.

  
Fixed a game bug when 60% of votes are not pass the vote.
Plugin disable "Return to Lobby".
Fixed game bug "Voting is already started".
  
FAQ:
  Why player who created the vote not vote "Yes" automatically?
  It might be for trolling. If an inattentive player votes "YES" when he is being kicked.
  
  Why plugin allow to vote kick players from another team
  This is a game bug that has existed since the release. I'm not going to change the established mechanics of the game.
  
  Why is the plugin so poor?
  Don't use it. Or modify.
